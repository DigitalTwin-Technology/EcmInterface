# Problem statement

In the VR application, I would like the ability to display an animation of the buses on their way to different parking slot types and notify the user when a bus arrives at a parking slot. The goal of this project is to implement these features in the Unity project.

## User Stories

1. As a user of a VR application, I want to be able to see an animation of the buses on the way to the different parking slot types (maintenance, charging, waiting, etc.).
2. As a user, I want to be able to receive UI notifications when a bus arrives at a parking slot

## Tasks

- Create a repository with the Unity project (US-1)
- Create bus prefab (US-1)
- Create bus animation (US-1)
- Create a bus collider event (US-1)
- Create the application scene (US-1)
- Set up the colliders in parking slots (US-1)
- Implement the collider event as a UI notification (US-2)
- Design and implement the UI notification (US-2)

## Success Criteria

- The bus animation is as smooth and realistic as possible
- The UI notification appears promptly when a bus arrives at a parking slot
- Users are able to easily differentiate between different parking slot types
